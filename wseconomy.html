               <h2>ECONOMIC IMACT ON INDIA OF COVID-19 </h2>
                
                <h3>Indian GDP in Doldrums:</h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll">As the <i>world’s fifth largest economy by GDP</i>, India has been reeling in some distress over the last few quarters. India’s GDP <i>slumped</i> to 4.7% in the third quarter of FY 2019-20, <b>the lowest rate of growth over the previous five years. </b>
                    <br>
                With a decline in private investments and domestic consumption, India’s GDP has now been <i>further exacerbated by the pandemic.</i>
                    <br>
                With the Prime Minister announcing a complete lockdown for 21 days earlier, the GDP growth rate was estimated to decline to a little above 2%. However, with the central government extending the lockdown until May 3 and then May 17 , <i>India’s GDP growth rate may dip to 0%, as per analyst estimates.</i></p>
                                      
                <h3>GDP Rating:</h3>
                <p  class="paraAll">The economic impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. The World Bank and credit rating agencies have downgraded India's growth for fiscal year 2021 with the <i>lowest figures India</i> has seen in three decades since India's economic liberalization in the 1990s.  <b>India should prepare for a negative growth rate in FY21.</b> However, the International Monetary Fund projection for India for the Financial Year 2021-22 of 1.9% GDP growth is the <i>highest among G-20 nations.</i></p>
                                           
                <h3>Unemployment:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">Within a month, unemployment rose from 6.7% on 15 March to 26% on 19 April. During the lockdown, an estimated 14 crore (140 million) people have lost employment. More than 45% of households across the nation have reported an income drop as compared to the previous year. </p>

                <h3>Economic Movement:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">The Indian economy was expected to lose over ₹32,000 crore (US$4.5 billion) every day during the first 21-days of complete lockdown, which was declared following the coronavirus outbreak. Under complete lockdown, less than a quarter of India's $2.8 trillion economic movement was functional. </p>
                
                <h3>Market:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">Up to 53% of businesses in the country were projected to be significantly affected. Supply chains have been <i>put under stress</i> with the lockdown restrictions in place; initially, there was a lack of clarity in streamlining what an <i>"essential" </i>is and what is not. Those in the informal sectors and daily wage groups are the most at risk.
                    <br>
                A large number of farmers around the country who grow perishables are also <i>facing uncertainty</i>. Various businesses such as hotels and airlines, are <i>cutting salaries and laying off employees.</i> 
                    <br>
                Young startups have been impacted as funding has fallen. Fast-moving consumer goods companies in the country have significantly <i>reduced operations and are focusing on essentials</i>. Some defense deals have been affected/delayed due to the pandemic, such as the delivery of Dassault Rafale fighter jets. <b>Stock markets in India posted their worst loses in history on 23 March 2020.</b> </p>
