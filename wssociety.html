                <h3>Economic danger versus health risk:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">
                    <i>
                    India risks economic hara-kiri [suicide] if lockdown extended for much longer.</i><br>
                    -Anand Mahindra, 11 May 2020, <br><br>
                    
                    In March, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India said that <i>"the economic danger of the outbreak was exponentially greater than its health risks”.</i><br> On 29 April, Indian billionaire NR Narayana Murthy said that if the lockdown continues, India may see more death due to hunger than from the pandemic. </p>
                
                
                <h3>Salaries:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">
                The Prime Minister on 19 March urged businesses and high income segments of society to take care of the economic needs of all those who provide them services. During the live telecast, he also appealed to families to not cut the pay of domestic help. Following the lockdown, the government circulated advisories and directives ordering companies to keep paying employees among other things. The Ministry of Finance issued an Office Memorandum on 23 March 2020.
                    <br><br>
                A few days later<i> worries grew</i> as to how wages could continue being paid and if the directive was <i>legal</i> or not. There were also concerns raised by <i>migrant workers</i> regarding the implementation of the orders as many daily-wagers have<b> no records of being sacked or salaries being paid or deducted;</b> the concerns also expand to uncertainty in the government's ability to enforce minimum wages under lockdown <b>when it couldn't even do so during normal times.</b>
                    <br>
                On 15 May, the Supreme Court announced that the government should not take <i>"coercive action" </i>against employees for not paying wages during the lockdown. The court was commenting on 29 March government order. </p>
                
                
                <h3>Migrant workers and labour force:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">
                Due to the lockdown, daily-wage workers (the urban poor and migrant laborers) were left with no work. At the same time, the lockdown restrictions put a stop on the movement of buses and trains. Large numbers of migrant workers ended up walking back to there villages, some journeys hundreds of kilometers long. <b>Social distancing was <i>not possible</i></b> for these migrants, who travelled together in large groups. 
                    <br><br>
                Soon after a central government directive in late March, state governments set up 21,000 camps to house over 660,000 migrants and stop the exodus. 
                By 5 April, 7,500,000 people were being provided food across the country in good caps run by the government and NGOs.</p>
                               
                
                <h3>Suspension of MPLADS:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">The Modi government, in view of the coronavirus pandemic, <i>suspended</i> <b>Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)</b> for two years. 
                    <br><br>
                This action has been called <i>problematic</i> in many ways, including causing a <b>centralisation of power, being anti-federal</b> in nature, and having an affect on local level development and MP influence at micro levels of the society to handle distress. There have been calls for halting the ₹20,000 crore (US$2.8 billion) redevelopment of the central vista project in Delhi instead. </p>

                
                <h3>Lockdown extension:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">
                On 8 April 2020, the managing director of Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, wrote in an opinion piece in the Economic Times that the<i> "lockdown makes India weak rather than stronger in combating the epidemic,"</i> and that the current<i> "arbitrary"</i> lockdown was totally unsustainable and a <i>"recalibration"</i> is needed.
                    <br>
                Rajiv Bajaj writes that <i>"India may have to sell itself out of the coronavirus crisis".</i>
