                <h2>IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE COUNTRY INDIA:</h2>
                
                <br>
                
                <p class="paraAll"><i>India reported the first confirmed case of the coronavirus infection on 30 January 2020 in the state of Kerala. The affected had a travel history from Wuhan, China.</i></p>
                
                <h3>Early Action:</h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll"><b>India did better than many countries</b> — from screening of travellers to phased escalation of travel restrictions and lockdown. India responded quickly, often ahead of many countries, and its responses were dynamic, evolving with time. 
                    <br><br>
                For example take the case of the export of <i>Personal Protection Equipment (PPE),</i> including clothing and N95 masks, which India prohibited on January 31, 40 days before the World Health Organisation declared Covid-19 a pandemic. 
                    <br><br>
                <b>One of the wrongs:</b> But, in February, with few cases, New Delhi <i>relaxed its grip</i>. The nation appeared to be in a quandary whether to replenish medical gears in hospitals, pharmacies and homes, or to carry on exports as usual, supplying masks and other materials to Europe, the Middle East and the US, a growing opportunity as the factories in the virus-hit China remained shut. 
                India also <i>derived comfort </i>from another fact — from the time three Wuhan-returned students in Kerala tested Covid-19 positive to the Union health ministry’s reporting of two fresh cases on March 2, there was a month-long lull. 
                    <br>
                Un February, it relaxed its export norms — first, on February 8, by removing items such as surgical masks and gloves from the banned list, and second, on February 25, allowing export of 10 items, including surgical blades and gas masks.
                    <br>
                It was only on March 19 when <b>the number of Covid-19 cases jumped</b> to 150 and the importance of ventilators in containing deaths was demonstrated globally, that Udyog Bhawan sprang into action, banning export of both surgical masks and all kinds of ventilators. and sanitisers, however, remained a free export item till March 24, one day before the nationwide lockdown.
                    <br>
                <i> So while in February, India slowed down in its Covid preparation due to zero fresh cases, in March it quickly shifted gears.</i></p>

                <h3>Control and Calibration:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">Where the government could have done better was possibly in its planning. Take the decision of the 21-day lockdown. <i>“It’s not an easy thing to do. What you are doing is buying time to flatten the curve,”</i> says K Viswanath, director of the India Research Center at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. 
                    <br>
                While the countrywide lockdown was necessary, it is also true that <i><b>“we could have been better prepared,” </b></i>says Reddy, referring to<i> hardships faced by migrant workers.</i></p>
                

                <h3>Testing Conundrum:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">The Indian government has come in for a lot of criticism for its conservative testing strategy, but how much of it is justified? India has done around 50 tests per million people, compared with 8,800 in South Korea and 3,900 in the US. <i>Should we have tested more by now?</i></p>
                
                <h3>War Chest:</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">Among all the most <i>disappointed</i> is corporate India. Reeling from unprecedented crisis, countries have opened up their war chest to support businesses. The support measures India has announced counts among the weakest globally.
                    <br><br>
                While our restrictive measures are among the boldest, these have been followed by a modest $22 billion (Rs 1.7 lakh crore) package. True, India entered the battlefield with an economy that had been slowing down for multiple quarters. With rising fiscal deficit and low tax collections, the package is a mix of food security and direct cash transfer focused on the poor — distressed migrant and daily wage workers. Look at the micro, small and medium enterprises sector, comprising of 60 million enterprises with 110 million workers, to understand the pain.
                    <br>
                The government has announced that it will contribute PF and ESIC for both employees and companies (with under 100 as staff ) for three months. Those with salaries above Rs 21,000 have not been covered.</p>
                
                               
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
                <p class="paraAll"><i>The government, aware of its shortcomings, is probably at work to address the issues.</i>
                    <br><br>
                Everything, from India’s early handling of foreign travellers and airport protocols to testing strategies, ill-equipped healthcare workers, poor handling of migrant workers and meagre support for the industry, is being debated threadbare in <i>locked-down drawing rooms</i> and <i>overheated social media.
                        <br><br>
                </i> <b>It’s understandable when the nation is at war with a deadly invisible enemy — a virus.</b> Panic-stricken citizens, confined to their home bunkers, are closely monitoring grim news flowing in from home and abroad. Infections and death counts are rising.
                        <br>
                <b> Doctors are attacked. Healthcare staff demand masks and protective gears even as hotels and trains are converted into quarantine zones and hospitals.</b></p>
