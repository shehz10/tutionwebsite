                <h2>What COVID-19 is?</h2>
                
                <h3>What is it!?</h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of <i>coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)</i>, caused by <i>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2)</i>. The outbreak was first identified in <b>Wuhan, China, in December 2019</b>.
                    <br><br>
                The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a <b>Public Health Emergency of International Concern </b>on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 19 May 2020,<b> more than 4.8 million cases</b> of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 318,000 deaths. More than 1.78 million people have recovered from the virus.
                    
                <h3>Cause:</h3>    
                <p class="paraAll">The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by <i>coughing, sneezing, and talking.</i> The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is<b><i> most contagious</i> during the first three days after the onset of symptoms</b>, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.
                       <br>   <br>
                <i>Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell.</i> 
                 Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.</p>
                
               
                
                <h3>Prevention </h3>
                <p class="paraAll">Recommended preventive measures include<b> hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, and monitoring and <i>self-isolation</i></b> for people who suspect they are infected. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. 
                    <br>
                Many places have also worked to <b>increase testing</b> capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                <p class="paraAll">The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days. Some infected people have no symptoms, known as <i>asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers</i>; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible. As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5% to 80%.
                Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). 
                    <br><br>
                Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, and diarrhea. Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. 
                    <br><br>
                Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.</p>
                
                <h3>Global health</h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll">The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain.The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital." 
                    <br><br>
                There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment. Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions. 
                    <br><br>
                In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex. Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic. 
                    <br>
                The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally.</p>
                
                <h3>Environment </h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll">The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The severe decline in planned travel has caused many regions to experience a<b> drop in air pollution</b>. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 per cent reduction in carbon emissions and 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least <b>77,000 lives</b> over two months.
                    <br><br>
                However, the outbreak has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and poaching in Africa, hindered environmental diplomacy efforts, and created economic fallout that is predicted to slow investment in green energy technologies. </p>
                
                <h3>Misinformation</h3>
                
                <p class="paraAll">The pandemic has resulted in <i>conspiracy theories</i> and misinformation about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media, text messaging, and mass media including the tabloid media, conservative media, and state media of countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkmenistan. 
                    <br><br>
                It has also been spread by state-backed covert operations to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries. 
                Misinformation has been propagated by celebrities, politicians (including heads of state in countries such as the United States, Iran, and Brazil), and other prominent public figures. 
                    <br><br>
                <i>Commercial scams</i> have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and <i>"miracle" </i>cures. Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus. Some people have claimed the virus is a<i> bio-weapon</i> accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory, a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation, or linked to 5G networks. 
                    <br><br>
                The World Health Organization has declared an <i>"infodemic"</i> of incorrect information about the virus, which poses risks to global health. </p>
